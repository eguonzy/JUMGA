The Challenge:
A group of business owners want to create an e-commerce market place (Codename: Jumga). Something like Jumia or Konga. They hope to set up their services in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and the UK for starters. You have been tapped as one of the possible dev candidates to handle setting up the payments side of things for the marketplace. 

Their MVP requirements for payments are as follows:
1. Each seller setting up on the platform pays a small token for approval.
2. For every sale, the total sale amount is broken down to be shared as follows: 

As an example, if a t-shirt from a seller (Digital Wears Ltd) costs $2,000 and the delivery fee is $150.
A sale of the t-shirt will result in the below breakdown:
(a) Jumga gets a commission of $50
(b) Digital Wears Ltd gets $1950
(c) The dispatch rider gets $120 while
(d) Jumga gets another $30 delivery commission
Jumga has decided to use Flutterwave because of their awesome reputation and the fact that they have support for accepting payments in the countries Jumga wants to start with. 

As a tapped dev candidate, your job is to develop the Jumga platform with Flutterwave v3 APIs. Sellers can create shops on the platform, each shop will be assigned a Jumga dispatch rider. Sales from the shops will be split according to the breakdown above.
The most attention will go to your implementation of the payment processes, however building a platform with a great UI and UX could earn you extra points. 

Things to note:
- Merchants can create shops on Jumga.
- Each shop is assigned a dispatch rider.
- Each shop can collect payments from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and UK.
- Each shop created on Jumga pays a token of $20 to Jumga, once payment is confirmed, the shop will be approved.
- Every sale will be split according to the appropriate percentages between Jumga, the shop owner (merchant) and the dispatch rider.
